My data set is 2018 world cup prediction. We knew the results of 2018 world cup prediction, 
so we could compare it with our prediction to see if our data analysis is reliable.

The first quetion I would ask is what exactly do I want to find out? Then I will move to 
which statistical analysis techniques do I want to apply?

There are dozens of statistical analysis techniques that we can use. However, these 3 
statistical techniques are most widely used for analysis:

Regression Analysis – a statistical process for estimating the relationships and 
correlations among variables.

Cohort Analysis – it enables we to easily compare how different groups, or cohorts, of 
customers, behave over time.

Predictive & Prescriptive Analysis– in short, it is based on analyzing current and 
historical datasets to predict future possibilities.
